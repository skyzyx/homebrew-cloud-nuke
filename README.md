# homebrew-cloud-nuke

**[Cloud Nuke](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke)** was created for situations when you might have an account you use for testing and need to clean up leftover resources so you're not charged for them. Also great for cleaning out accounts with redundant resources. Also great for removing unnecessary defaults like default VPCs and permissive ingress/egress rules in default security groups.
